### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm another software engineer...

- I hate NullPointerExceptions.
- I love the feeling when all the tests pass successfully.
- Lately, I've been exploring the Cloud and decided to continue this new journey.

I work with:
- Java (almost daily)
- Python (for automation)
- Go (just for fun)
